It does everything from increasing a person's lifespan to making interstellar travel possible. And it can only be found on a single planet: the inhospitable desert world Arrakis. Whoever controls Arrakis controls the spice. And whoever controls the spice controls the universe. When the emperor transfers stewardship of Arrakis from the noble House Harkonnen to House Atreides, the Harkonnens fight back, murdering Duke Leto Atreides. Lady Jessica, Duke Leto's concubine, flees into the desert with their young son Paul, where they are rescued by a band of Fremen, the native people of Arrakis. The Fremen control Arrakis' second great resource: the monstrous works that burrow beneath the burning desert sands. In order to raise an army to avenge his father and retake Arrakis from the Harkonnens, Paul must earn the trust of the Fremen and lead a tiny army against the innumerable forces aligned against them. His journey will change everything.","id":"pCvvkMwLyg4ILFMirpxo","author":{"name":"Frank Herbert"}}},{"node":{"title":"Children of Dune","localImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":200,"height":358,"src":"/static/09ad806132efa107d627542b8b265cde/f836f/dune3.jpg","srcSet":"/static/09ad806132efa107d627542b8b265cde/f836f/dune3.jpg 1x"}}},"summary":"Nine years after Emperor Paul Muad'Dib walked into the desert, blind, the ecological transformation of Dune has reached the point where some Fremen are living without stillsuits in the less arid climate and have started to move out of the sietches and into the villages and cities. As the old ways erode, more and more pilgrims arrive to experience the planet of Muad'Dib. The Imperial high council has lost its political might and is powerless to control the Jihad.  Paul's young twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, have concluded that their guardian Alia has succumbed to Abomination—possession by her grandfather Baron Vladimir Harkonnen—and fear that a similar fate awaits them. They (and Alia) also realize that the terraforming of Dune will kill all the sandworms, thus destroying the source of the spice, but Harkonnen desires this outcome. Leto also fears that, like his father, he will become trapped by his prescience.","id":"qU9ne2xUUjT7vZJHzK2H","author":{"name":"Frank Herbert"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
